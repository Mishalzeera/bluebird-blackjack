# Bluebird Blackjack

A simple blackjack game with a virtual live music experience. Styled according to a vintage Raj/colonial era look, but musically evocative of surf and early RnB.

## The user

The user is the kind of person who wants a quick, handy game on their phone to play when they have to wait in line somewhere. She or he have their headphones in all the time and are easily beguiled by sounds and images. They are the type who get hooked on one game for long periods and appreciate something as simple and classic as a good blackjack game.

The music is a central aspect of the game, and the user is a fan of classic surf and RnB from the 1960s.

## What Bluebird Blackjack offers
